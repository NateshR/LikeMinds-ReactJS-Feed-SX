## About LikeMinds

> Businesses are increasingly investing in building communities as they enable P2P value creation, retention, product stickiness and referrals. However, building in-app communities takes years of engineering efforts resulting in most brands either not building a community or building it from scratch on 3rd party platforms.

> LikeMinds is a simple plug and play, highly customisable community infra platform that helps brands build in-app communities in 15 mins. Brands can leverage the platform to build community features like group chats, 1-1 chats, activity feed, event management, resource library quickly without any engineering effort.
